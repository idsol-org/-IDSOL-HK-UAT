The poster board is often used during presentations or exhibitions to quickly communicate the core aspects of your project.</p><h4 class="question"><strong>What is the Pitch Deck?</strong></h4><p>A pitch deck is a visual presentation that provides an overview of your project idea. The purpose of a pitch deck is to clearly and concisely communicate the value proposition, market opportunity, and competitive advantages of your data science solution. It is designed to persuade stakeholders, such as judges, investors, or potential partners, of the viability and impact of your project.</p><h4 class="question"><strong>What Level of Technicality is Expected?</strong></h4><p>The most important aspect of a data science solution is the design. A strong design is crucial for success, even if the implementation is not fully developed. While it is not required to implement a working prototype to demonstrate technical skills—meaning no coding is necessary—teams are welcome to include technical details or prototypes if they believe it enhances the explanation of their solution.</p><h4 class="question"><strong>How Many Proposals Are Allowed Per Team?</strong></h4><p>Teams may pursue multiple project proposals and can enter multiple proposals for the exhibition event. However, each team is only allowed to compete with one proposal in the main competition.</p><h4 class="question"><strong>What is the Criteria for Team Formation?</strong></h4><p>Teams may be composed of 1 to 6 eligible individuals. Each team must designate one member as the team lead. Individuals are not permitted to be part of more than one team.</p><h4 class="question"><strong>Could My Teammates Be from Different Schools?</strong></h4><p>Yes, teammates can be from different schools. The representative school will be the one of the team leader. If a team includes both secondary and tertiary-level members, and at least one member is from a tertiary-level institution, the team will be classified as a tertiary-level team.</p><h4 class="question"><strong>What is the Eligibility of Individual Participants?</strong></h4><p>Current and recent students (without age limit) may register as competitors. The Competitions Committee may request proof of enrollment or proof of graduation.</p><h4 class="question"><strong>Definitions:</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Current Secondary-Level Students:</strong> Any current student studying at a secondary academic institution (ISCED 2011 level 2-4).</li><li><strong>Current Tertiary-Level Students:</strong> Any current student studying at a tertiary academic institution (ISCED 2011 level 5-8).</li><li><strong>Recent College or University Students:</strong> Any recent student of a tertiary academic institution within and including up to three (3) years since graduation or hiatus.
